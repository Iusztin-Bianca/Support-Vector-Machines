# Support-Vector-Machines
Project accomplished in a ML course :Python for machine learning and data science bootcamp. 
This projects uses the Support Vector Machines algorithm to classify an iris flower type. We use the Iris flower data set from seaborn.
There are 3 posible species of Iris: Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor. The algorith predicts one of these 3 types.
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of the 3 species of Iris, so 150 total samples.
For each sample, four features were measured: the length of the sepals and petals, and the width of the sepals and petals(in centimeters).
